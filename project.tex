Let $q$ be a prime power, $\kappa=\dF_q$, and $X$ be a subvariety of 
$\dP_\kappa^n$ defined over $\kappa$. Let $S=\kappa[x_0,\dots,x_n]$ be the 
homogeneous coordinate ring of $\dP_\kappa^n$, and for each $d\geq 0$ let 
$S_d$ be the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ in $S$. We have 
$\# S_d = q^{\binom{n+d}{n}}$. For any $f\in S_{\hom}=\bigcup_d S_d$, let 
$H_f\subset \dP_\kappa^n$ be the corresponding hypersurface. We would like 
\[
  \#\{f\in S_d:H_f\cap X\text{ is smooth}\} = q^{\binom{n+d}{n}} + O(q^r) ,
\]
for some $r<\binom{n+d}{n}$. 

Let's start with a baby case. We can study the density of the set of 
polynomials $f\in \dF_q[t]$ such that $V(f)$ is smooth, i.e. $f$ has no 
double roots. We would like 
\[
  \#\{f\in \dF_q[t]_{\leq d} : f\text{ squarefree}\} = \left(1-\frac 1 q\right) q^{d+1} + O(q^{d+1-\varepsilon}) .
\]
for some (hopefully explicit) $\varepsilon>0$. Recall that 
\[
  1-\frac 1 q = \prod_{x\in |\dA_{\dF_q}^1|} (1-|x|^{-2}) = \zeta_{\dA_{\dF_q}^1}(2)^{-1} .
\]
Let $X=\dA_{\dF_q}^1$. Let $r\geq 0$ be an integer, and let $X_{<r}$ be the 
set of closed points in $X$ of degree $<r$. 





\section{Abstract sieves}

Let $X$ be a set with a function $d:X\to \dN$. We assume that for all 
$n\geq 1$, the sets $X_n=\{x\in X:d(x) = n\}$ are finite. For a set 
$S\subset X$, consider 
\[
  \theta_S(n) = \#(S\cap X_n). 
\]
The hope is for $\theta_S\sim \alpha\theta_X$ for some real number $\alpha$. 
Even better, we would like $\theta_S=\alpha\theta_X+O(\theta_X^{1-\varepsilon})$ 
for some $\varepsilon>0$.
